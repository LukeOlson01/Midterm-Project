# Introduction

Hello! My name is Luke Olson. I am a sophmore at the University of Missouri. This is my third semester at the College of Engineering. This is my first semester being on campus
for in person classes. I'm glad to finally be able to see my school and meet my professors.  
I am majoring in Information Technology. I am new to programming but I am enjoying it so far!
