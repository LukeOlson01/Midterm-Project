# Introduction

Hello! My name is Luke Olson. I am a sophmore at the _University of Missouri_. This is my third semester at the _College of Engineering_. This is my first semester being on campus
for in person classes. I'm glad to finally be able to see my school and meet my professors.  
I am majoring in **Information Technology**. Information about this degree can be found [here](https://engineering.missouri.edu/academics/it/it-degrees/bs-it/). I am new to programming but I am enjoying it so far!
