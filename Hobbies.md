# Hobbies

I enjoy spending time outside biking and hiking on the many trails around Columbia.  
I also love to travel, whether it be somewhere around the country or overseas. I always look forward to visiting a new place and spending time with family during our trips.  
I enjoy cooking and spend a lot of time doing it as I work at a food truck every week.  
Now that I am learning, I also might start new projects outside of school so I can get better at it.
